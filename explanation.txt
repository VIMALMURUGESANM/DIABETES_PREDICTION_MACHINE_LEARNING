Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects how your
body processes blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for your body's
cells, and insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps to regulate blood sugar levels by
allowing glucose to enter cells.

In diabetes, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or can't effectively use the insulin it
produces, leading to high levels of glucose in the blood. There are three main types of diabetes:

Type 1 diabetes: This occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and
destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. People with type 1 diabetes need to
take insulin injections or use an insulin pump to manage their blood sugar levels.

Type 2 diabetes: This is the most common form of diabetes and occurs when the body
becomes resistant to insulin or doesn't produce enough insulin to maintain normal blood
sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise, along with medications and insulin therapy if needed.

Gestational diabetes: This type of diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually goes away
after the baby is born. However, women who develop gestational diabetes are at higher risk
of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.

Untreated or poorly managed diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart
disease, stroke, kidney disease, nerve damage, and blindness. It's important to work with your
healthcare team to manage your diabetes and keep your blood sugar levels within a healthy
range.
